    "```conda``` is a cross-platform package manager, and ```conda-forge```, a package channel. Anaconda Inc. (formerly Continuum IO), the main developers of the ```conda``` software, also maintain a separate channel of packages, which is the ```default``` when you type ```conda install packagename``` without changing any options.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four main reasons to use the ```conda-forge``` channel instead of the ```default``` channel maintained by Anaconda:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Packages on conda-forge may be more up-to-date than those on the defaults channel \n",
    "- There are packages on the conda-forge channel that aren't available from defaults\n",
    "- You would prefer to use a dependency such as openblas (from conda-forge) instead of mkl (from defaults).\n",
    "- If you are installing a package that requires a compiled library (e.g., a C extension or a wrapper around a C library), it may reduce the chance of incompatibilities if you install all of the packages in an environment from a single channel due to binary compatibility of the base C library (but this advice may be out of date/change in the future). For reference, see the Conda Forge post on mixing channels.\n",
